# **Real-Time Sign Language Detection**

A deep-learning powered system that detects and classifies hand gestures in real time using **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and **Computer Vision techniques**, converting sign language gestures into text.

---

##  **Overview**

This project aims to assist communication for hearing- and speech-impaired individuals by interpreting sign language gestures from a live camera feed.
A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is trained on labeled gesture images, and OpenCV is used for real-time video capture and prediction.

The system is lightweight, accurate, and performs gesture-to-text translation instantly.

##  **Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sign-language-detection.git
cd sign-language-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---


```

##  **Start Real-Time Detection**

```bash
python src/predict.py
```

---

##  **Model Workflow**

1. **Collect Dataset** (images of hand gestures)
2. **Preprocess** using OpenCV
3. **Train CNN model** using TensorFlow
4. **Real-time detection** through webcam
5. **Predict gesture** and display text

---

##  **Results**

*  High prediction accuracy
*  Stable real-time performance (20–30 FPS)
*  Effective for basic gesture recognition
